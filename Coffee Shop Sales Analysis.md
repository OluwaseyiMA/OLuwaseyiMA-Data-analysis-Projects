## Key Business Questions & Insights
### Which store location is the most profitable?
The Hell’s Kitchen location was the best-performing store, generating $237K (34%) of total sales.
Lower Manhattan followed with $232K (33%), and Astoria had $230K (33%) in sales.
The small variance in sales suggests that all three locations are performing well, with Hell’s Kitchen having a slight edge, possibly due to higher foot traffic.
## What is the peak month for sales, and what factors contributed to it?
June had the highest sales at $166K.
Sales showed steady growth from February ($76K) to June ($166K), with a significant spike in April and May.
### Potential factors for the peak include: 
* Seasonal demand: Warmer weather may have increased demand for cold coffee drinks.
* Promotions or special offers: The rise in sales suggests potential marketing campaigns may have influenced purchasing behavior.
## What are the peak hours for transactions?
The highest number of transactions occurred during morning hours, specifically at 8 AM, 9 AM, and 10 AM, with 19K, 18K, and 13K transactions, respectively.
Transaction volume declines after midday and remains low in the evening, indicating that most customers prefer purchasing in the morning.
This insight suggests that targeted morning promotions, breakfast deals, and loyalty programs could drive even higher engagement.

### Key Insight:
Beverages dominate sales, with brewed coffee leading in transactions while non-beverage products, such as clothing and organic chocolate, have minimal sales. 
This shows that there may be an opportunity to improve the sales of underperforming products through better marketing, bundle offers, or adjustments to product selection.
## Conclusion and Recommendations
### Optimize Marketing Efforts in High-Performing Locations
Since Hell’s Kitchen leads in total sales, targeted marketing efforts in this area could further enhance revenue.
Conducting customer surveys at this location could help identify key factors contributing to its success.
### Maximize Morning Sales Opportunities
Since morning hours (8 AM - 10 AM) are the peak transaction periods, coffee shop management should focus on promotions, loyalty rewards, and special breakfast offers during this time.
Offering "Early Bird Discounts" could further drive sales.
### Capitalize on Seasonal Demand
June saw the highest sales volume, indicating that seasonal factors influence purchasing behavior.
Introducing seasonal drinks (iced coffee, summer specials) and promotional campaigns could help sustain this growth in upcoming peak seasons.
### Adjust Inventory Management for Low-Selling Products
Since clothing, organic chocolate, and house blends are underperforming, the business should consider: 
* Promotional bundles to improve sales.
* Discontinuing or repurposing non-profitable products to reduce costs.
  
By implementing these recommendations, the coffee shop can enhance profitability, improve operational efficiency, and better meet customer preferences.
